# face_component_region
a very very simple and methods codes for getting face components region.
# Description
This is a very crude method to getting face different components region by using face alignment and grabcut. The final result is like face parsing, but far less than it.
(I don't know the face parsing when I write this code. This code was written a long time ago)
